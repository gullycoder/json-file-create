Answer: (d)
Option (d) is correct: The main cause of
tribal insurrection was the rapid changes
that the British introduced in the economy,
administration, and land revenue system.
These changes led to the disruption of the
old agrarian order of the tribal communities
causing prolonged and widespread suffering
among tribal communities. Also, increasing
demands for land revenue and extracting as
large an amount as possible by the British
government proved to be devastating for
Indian villages, throwing millions on the verge
of impoverishment. The British government
encroached upon the traditional tribal land
rendering tribals in a condition of destitution
in their own land.
