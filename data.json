  },
  "questionCorrectOption": "d",
  "questionAnswerExplanation": "Option (d) is correct: The main cause of tribal insurrection was the rapid changes that the British introduced in the economy, administration, and land revenue system. These changes led to the disruption of the old agrarian order of the tribal communities causing prolonged and widespread suffering among tribal communities. Also, increasing demands for land revenue and extracting as large an amount as possible by the British government proved to be devastating for Indian villages, throwing millions on the verge of impoverishment. The British government encroached upon the traditional tribal land rendering tribals in a condition of destitution in their own land."
